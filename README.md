# Project: Team App

**Hello!** 👋

A simple REST API built with NodeJS, used to query a MongoDB backend and fetch team members in a certain proximity. It's currently run on localhost on port 4000.

## Building the project

The workflow for this project focused majorly on the tools below:

1. Node JS

2. React compiled by babel in the frontend

3. Mongo DB

4. Express

5. GeoJSON

Users can look for team members within a 100km radius of these coordinates (-80, 25). With the simple functionality, searches have to real close. Working on adding functionality that enables users add more team members.

**Happy Coding!** 😄
